In Eclipse, go to File > Import
Select Git > Projects from Git (With Smart Import)
Select Clone URI
Use the following URI: https://github.com/MEuph/bpa2019.git
Select any destination
Click Finish.

If everything went right, you should now be able to use the Git project as a regular Java Eclipse project, but with Git integration!
