# Casha, The Chosen One

Midway ISD's Grass Roots Studios is proud to present our BPA 2019-2020 Project: Casha, The Chosen One

In Casha, you play as a small sapling named Casha, intent on getting revenge for the careless burning down of her parent trees. As Casha, you will fight pollution by stopping living trash monsters, and the man who killed your parents, Axel.
